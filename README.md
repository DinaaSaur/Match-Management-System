# Match-Management-System

Introducing the Match Management System, a comprehensive project I developed to streamline and organize sports matches and events. Powered by C# and ASP.NET, this web application offers a user-friendly interface created with Visual Studio Code.

The goal of this system is to simplify match bookings for players and organizers alike. Users can effortlessly search for available matches, book their spots, and even create teams, eliminating the need for tedious phone calls and confusing spreadsheets. Our robust database system, built with MS SQL, ensures smooth data management and retrieval.

For administrators, the system provides essential features to manage match schedules, track participant details, and handle payments. An intuitive dashboard offers real-time insights into ongoing activities. Throughout the development process, I collaborated with a team of talented individuals, pooling our coding skills and problem-solving abilities.
